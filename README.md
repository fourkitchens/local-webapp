# localStorage webapp prototype

An experiment by [Four Kitchens](http://fourkitchens.com)

## Dev notes

*LiveReload* - if you have LiveReload on your local machine, you can use it on a
mobile device by looking up your LAN IP (not external IP) and visiting that IP
on each device. LiveReload's script at the top of index.html will automatically
detect your local server and do its magic!

*grunt/bbb* - you should build the application using ```bbb release``` (a backbone
wrapper for grunt).

You can also cause the application to be rebuilt automatically using ```bbb watch```.
