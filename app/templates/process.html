  <h3 class="c1"><span>Project management methodology</span></h3>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">We practice the</span><span class="c6"><a class="c5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c9 c6"><a class="c5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29">Scrum project management methodology</a></span><span class="c6">, a form of</span><span class="c6"><a class="c5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="c6 c9"><a class="c5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile development</a></span><span class="c6">. We use short iterations called &quot;sprints,&quot; which are two-week intervals repeated throughout the development cycle of each project. Sprints allow us to balance our clients&#39; rapidly changing needs with our ability to internally focus and complete tasks. Each morning, the team holds a 15-minute &quot;daily scrum&quot; meeting to discuss what occurred on the project yesterday, what will occur today, and to assess and remove &quot;blockers.&quot; We use JIRA (an enterprise issue tracker) and Confluence (an enterprise wiki) to collaborate and track all bugs and tasks.</span></p>

  <h2 class="c1"><span class="c6">Every scrum team includes a dedicated Scrum Master and a Project Owner. The role of the Scrum Master is to serve as the main point of contact for all project-related questions, streamline communication, and keep the developers and designers on track. We have three Certified Scrum Masters on staff: Suzy Bates and Andrew Gerdes, our Directors of Project Management, and Leah Mason, our Director of Client Relations and Marketing.</span></h2>

  <h2 class="c1"><span class="c6">The Project Owner identifies, organizes, and prioritizes project requirements into cogent, incremental releases. Though the Project Owner role is usually served by the client, it&#39;s sometimes necessary for someone on our team to take on that role. In those cases, the Project Owner also functions as the client&#39;s representative on the team, ensuring that development efforts stay focused on the client&#39;s business goals. Four Kitchens Partners Todd Nienkerk and Aaron Stanush are both Certified Scrum Product Owners.</span></h2>

  <p class="c15 c1"></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Regardless who takes on the role of Project Owner, we&rsquo;ve found it is critical that the client remain highly involved and invested throughout the project lifecycle. Our most successful projects are partnerships between us and clients who dedicate time to the project on a daily basis, effectively manage stakeholders within their organizations, and are empowered to make decisions. Projects in which the client is not available, invested, and empowered are likely to face budgetary challenges due to high overhead.</span></p>

  <h3 class="c1"><span>Discovery and project planning</span></h3>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">During the discovery phase, we immerse ourselves in your goals, learn from the challenges you are facing, and seek to understand your processes, products, and people. We get to know you and what makes you and your audience tick. This phase is conducted as a conversation or workshop with you and other project stakeholders in which we identify business goals, technical requirements, user personas, and success criteria, as well as lay a strong foundation for the rest of the design and development process.</span></p>

  <h3 class="c1"><span>Design process</span></h3>

  <h4 class="c1"><span>Information architecture (IA)</span></h4>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">In the information architecture phase, we organize content and establish site hierarchy and navigation. We often audit existing content to develop a forward-facing content strategy and inventory. Using our comprehensive understanding of your content, we will create a site map that outlines and emphasizes the relationships between the content and the goals of your organization and users.</span></p>

  <h4 class="c1"><span>User experience (UX)</span></h4>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">The user experience process analyzes and proposes functionality and user interaction through the use of rough sketches called &quot;wireframes.&quot; The wireframes illustrate the placement of content, navigation, and user interface elements such as search boxes and commenting forms. They are the &quot;skeletons&quot; on which the look, feel, and functionality of the site are built. The process of building and discussing wireframes is highly agile, meaning that we can react quickly to feedback and changes before development even begins.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Wireframes can also be used as effective and low-cost tools for testing. Rather than building a full prototype of a site &mdash; or waiting until after the site is done! &mdash; we often show potential users a set of wireframes to help us understand if the proposed site structure and its components are intuitive and easy to use. This &quot;user testing&quot; process is highly valuable and can reveal new information for further exploration or revision.</span></p>

  <h4 class="c1"><span>Style tiles</span></h4>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Unlike many similar firms, we perform all design and theming in-house. And unlike many design firms, we do not deliver a fixed number of design concepts or iterations. Instead, we begin the development of visual comps with the concept of &quot;style tiles,&quot; lightweight designs that express style preferences drawn from your own words and indications. They focus our understanding of your organization&rsquo;s sensibilities by bringing you into the design conversation early so that your preferences can steer the process most effectively. We&rsquo;ve found that these indicators shorten the distance between wireframe and visual design, resulting in significant time and cost savings.</span></p>

  <h4 class="c1"><span>Visual design</span></h4>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">The visual design (also known as a &quot;comp&quot;) will represent a refined culmination of our in-depth analysis and discovery phase, the descriptive structure of your site captured by the information architecture process, the functional skeleton of your site provided by the user experience design and wireframes, and your design preferences gleaned from the style tiles. Through each step of the design process, needs are refined, goals are discovered, and requirements are clarified. The visual design stands together with the other deliverables &mdash; business goals, personas, sitemap, wireframes, etc. &mdash; as a comprehensive guide to development throughout the project.</span></p>

  <h3 class="c1"><span>Development process</span></h3>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">Four Kitchens helped establish development best practices while working on some of the largest Drupal sites in the world, and we apply this expertise in systems administration, technical architecture, coding and testing strategies, performance, and best practices to every project and custom feature we build. All work is version-controlled, tested, and peer-reviewed within a standard development-staging-production workflow. When necessary, we performance-test new functionality to ensure the site remains quick and stable.</span></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">We include as much configuration as possible &quot;in code&quot; using features, exportables, and other configuration management techniques. Not only is this standard procedure on all of our projects, we helped establish Drupal best practices in this area by pioneering the technique of including all configuration changes in update hooks that are run automatically when code is pushed live. Though this particular technique may not be critical for this project, it&#39;s one of many we can employ and evidence of our expertise in the areas of exportability and configuration management.</span></p>

  <h3 class="c1"><span>Community engagement and social media strategy</span></h3>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">An all-encompassing digital strategy no longer involves just your own presence on your own hosted sites, but thinking through your presence in other social platforms. Users increasingly find information they need organically through social sites. Thinking through how users will find you in social platforms and guiding their experience until they find their way to your site &mdash; that is, how you engage your community using social media &mdash; should be a part of every digital strategy. A good community engagement and social media strategy will:</span></p>

  <p class="c15 c1"></p>

  <ol class="c11" start="1">
      <li class="c4 c1"><span class="c17 c6">Help with your new site launch.</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Launching a website is like opening a restaurant: Users won&rsquo;t come visit you unless you get the word out. An engagement strategy will help get the word out on all relevant social media channels.</span></li>

      <li class="c4 c1"><span class="c17 c6">Educate users on new features.</span> <span class="c6">&quot;New&quot; can be sometimes be scary, and as you launch a new site, users are increasingly counting on social media to get their questions answered. Social media enables you to preemptively answer questions and serve your users in a timely manner at a lower cost than traditional support.</span></li>

      <li class="c4 c1"><span class="c17 c6">Create a holistic view of who you are.</span> <span class="c6">Imagine social media channels as roads to your house. Wouldn&rsquo;t you want to ensure that your visitors had the best experience possible as they get to your home? A consistent experience across platforms will generate a more positive user experience once users find their way to your site.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c15 c1"></p>

  <p class="c1"><span class="c6">We will never simply say &quot;you need to be on Facebook.&quot; Although Facebook is the leading social platform, it is not always the answer for every audience or use-case. Maybe, for your industry, you should really be maximizing your LinkedIn presence, or maybe venturing into new platforms. Whatever your goals are, Four Kitchens can help fine-tune all the roads that lead home.</span></p>
