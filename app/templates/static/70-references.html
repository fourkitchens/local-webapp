  <p>We will gladly furnish references if we are considered a finalist in the
  selection process for this proposal. Because we obtain permission each time we
  list a reference, we need to minimize the number of times we release their
  names and personal contact information.</p>
  
  <p>Please understand that this policy is in place because we highly value our
  clients' and colleagues' time and privacy.</p>
