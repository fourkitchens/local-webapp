<div class="box">

  <p>While this is not a comprehensive list of our top-notch developers,
  designers, and support staff, the following Web Chefs will likely be assigned
  to the Microfinance Gateway project.</p>

  <h4>Todd Ross Nienkerk</h4>
  
  <p><em>Partner, Co-Founder, Digital Strategist</em><br /> Todd Nienkerk has
    been involved in the web design and publishing industries since 1996. Since
    that time, he has designed and built countless websites and written for,
    edited, and managed several online and print publications. Although Todd's
    interests focus primarily on visual design and user experience, his strong
    background in development allows him to contribute to virtually any creative
    or technical task. As an active member of the Drupal community, Todd
    regularly speaks at Drupal events and participates in code sprints all over
    the world. (In the last four years, he has spoken at 25 conferences and
    attended five code sprints in seven countries.) Todd is a member of the
    Drupal Documentation Team and has chaired tracks for DrupalCon Copenhagen
    2010, DrupalCon Chicago 2011, DrupalCon Denver 2012, and DrupalCon Munich
    2012. He is currently serving as the DrupalCon global chair for all design,
    user experience, mobile, and theming tracks. As a member of the Drupal.org
    Redesign Team, Todd helped spearhead the effort to redesign Drupal.org and
    communicate a fresher, more effective Drupal brand. Todd is also a Certified
    Scrum Product Owner.</p>

  <h4>Aaron Stanush</h4>
  
  <p><em>Partner, Co-Founder, Creative Director</em><br /> Aaron Stanush is a
    graphic artist and web designer who harbors a special love for logos,
    branding, and typography. Building large-scale websites occupies most of his
    time, with most of his efforts guiding sites' aesthetics and user
    experience. As a member of the Drupal.org Redesign Team, Aaron has
    participated in several Drupal.org redesign sprints held around the world.
    Aaron is also a Certified Scrum Product Owner.</p>

  <h4>Mike Minecki</h4>
  
  <p><em>Director of Technology, Technical Strategist</em><br /> Mike Minecki
    has been building websites since 1999. Lately he's focused on building
    scalable and usable web applications. Before moving to Austin to join the
    Web Chefs, Mike worked for some of Los Angeles' top interactive agencies on
    such projects as the1secondfilm.com and sdge.com. When he's not hacking in
    PHP or JavaScript, he spends his time tinkering on various interactive art
    projects, snowboarding, scuba diving, and spoiling his dog. Mike has a BFA
    in Printmaking from California State University Long Beach.</p>

  <h4>Leah Mason</h4>
  
  <p><em>Director of Client Relations, Marketing Strategist</em><br /> Leah
    Mason has a background in marketing, advertising, and project management.
    Leah has developed campaign strategy for brands like Don't Mess with Texas,
    Logitech, and Dell. She came to Four Kitchens inspired to collaborate daily
    with folks who love to learn and is driven by a desire to foster meaningful
    relationships. The things that make her happy include running the Lady Bird
    Lake hike-and-bike trail, playing drums loudly, singing loudly, drinking
    espresso, tap dancing, baking celebratory cakes, and enjoying live music.
    Leah is a Certified Scrum Master.</p>

  <h4>Cecy Correa</h4>
  
  <p><em>Director of Marketing and Community Outreach, Social Media and
    Marketing Strategist</em><br /> Cecy is a marketer who specializes in social
    media strategy and engagement, as well as community marketing and outreach.
    With a background in traditional media, Cecy has worked with for KLRU-
    Austin, the Discovery Channel, The Austin Film Festival, and The Weinstein
    Company. She soon moved into interactive marketing at Electronic Arts, where
    she created and managed online content creation and localization efforts for
    games like The Sims and Littlest Pet Shop. Cecy has also worked for Dell as
    an Online Campaign Manager and Social Media Lead for the Channel Marketing
    group. At Dell, Cecy was part of a training ambassador program, which
    allowed her to teach social media policy, governance and best practices to
    professional marketers within the company on a monthly basis. Before joining
    Four Kitchens, Cecy served as an Account Executive for interactive
    advertising agency Springbox, where she handled clients ranging from MSN
    Advertising, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, Dell, and New Era Portfolio. In
    her spare time, Cecy is part of a core group of organizers for Refresh
    Austin, one of the largest tech meet-ups in the city.</p>

  <h4>Suzy Bates</h4>
  
  <p><em>Director of Projects, Project Manager, Scrum Master</em><br /> Suzy has
    been managing projects on the web since the words &quot;client/server&quot;
    described the technology. Since then, she has worked in large organizations
    and small, as a consultant and inside IT helping people to understand the
    steps to success often require planning and following the plan, even when
    things are difficult. A certified Scrum Master, Suzy has experience with
    many manifestations of &quot;Agile in name only&quot; teams and was relieved
    to find that Four Kitchens has collaborative, communicative, functional
    Scrum practices. While holding a Masters of Science in Mechanical
    Engineering, it has never once gotten her out of an engineering jam. In
    fact, it has only complicated her abilities to help her sons, ages 8 and 10,
    in completing their Science Fair projects, as each year she is told that
    &quot;it's not an Engineering Fair.&quot;</p>
  
  <h4>Andrew Gerdes</h4>
  
  <p><em>Project Manager, Scrum Master</em><br /> Andrew joined Four Kitchens
    after several years of project-managing and developing mobile apps for
    Xerox, Coca-Cola Latin America, Gowalla, StumbleUpon, and Touch Medix. In
    previous lives, he managed an offshore team in Buenos Aires, developed web
    applications, and data-mined for criminal investigations as a research
    programmer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In addition to being
    passionate about changing the world through open-source software and
    technology, he loves bicycles, lindy hop, yoga, skiing, and travel. Andrew
    holds a Master of Science degree in Logic and Computation from Carnegie
    Mellon University and is a Certified Scrum Master.</p>

    development, databases, estimation and project management. Before becoming a
    web chef, he worked for many years in academic and administrative IT at the
    University of Texas at Austin including the Web Central team where he
    supported hundreds of web publishers in a diverse ecology of web publishing
    needs. He was the project manager and later technical lead of UT's core
    website refresh and transition to Drupal. David's work at UT also includes

    technologies since creating his middle school's website in sixth grade.
    Before becoming a Web Chef, Ian worked in a variety of industries from
    advertising to construction. When he isn't coding or maintaining his own
    servers at home, he can be found running around Town Lake or conversing with
    mixologists around town. Ian holds a degree in Asian Studies from the
    University of Texas at Austin, speaks Mandarin, Japanese, and Spanish, and
    also studied theatrical lighting technologies.</p>

  <h4>Vivek Goel</h4>
  
  <p><em>Developer</em><br /> Vivek Goel began building websites for bands,
    student organizations, and his own curiosity at the University of Texas at
    Austin in 1997, where he developed a strong interest in client- and server-
    side scripting languages. Vivek then spent several years building complex
    web applications at Tyler Technologies and National Instruments, where he
    placed strong emphasis on code reusability and elegant algorithms. After
    making a departure from technology and returning to school to get an MBA,
    Vivek combined his interest in business, finance, and technology to work in
    the fast-paced equity-trading industry. An overwhelming desire to return to
    &quot;building things&quot; led him to back to web development and Four
    Kitchens.</p>

    perfecting the markup of websites since 2001. A passionate advocate of web

    backstage, around the lake, or sitting on a great patio with his dogs.
    Taylor graduated from The University of Tulsa with a BFA in Graphic
    Design.</p>

  <h4>Jared Rogers</h4>
  
  <p><em>Designer, Themer</em><br /> Jared Rogers solves problems through visual
    design. He comes from an art background and is self-taught in the ways of
    web markup and style. He's creative from the big idea, which he has no
    shortage of, down to the last pixel. (His work was recently featured in
    Smashing Magazine!) When he's not scouring the internet for design
    brilliance, he's probably cooking up a new recipe or taking a calm breath at
    the yoga studio. Jared has a degree in visual design from the University of
    Northern Iowa.</p>

  <h4>Elliott Foster</h4>
  
  <p><em>Developer, Systems Administrator</em><br /> Elliott Foster is a
