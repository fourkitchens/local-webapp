A certified Scrum Master, Suzy has experience with many manifestations of &quot;Agile in name only&quot; teams and was relieved to find that Four Kitchens has collaborative, communicative, functional Scrum practices. While holding a Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering, it has never once gotten her out of an engineering jam.
