        <h2>We're not vendors, we're strategic partners</h2>
        <p class="summary">Our strategy services help realize your vision &mdash; or create one for you.</p>

        <p>We are your peers. We are driven to collaboratively arrive at meaningful, effective and efficient end products. While a smart and creative approach is part-and-parcel to our design and development process for all projects, sometimes our clients need more. Our team will work with you to understand your business goals and user needs and apply our in-depth expertise to produce creative, technical and/or marketing briefs. This discovery process will be rich &mdash; we will question your assumptions and push you (gently) to think outside the box. The resulting strategy documents will serve as roadmaps for smart implementation of the ideas and recommendations they contain.</p>

        <p>Some specific types of strategy services performed: mobile, performance, scalability, and community engagement.</p>

        <h2>Design for the future: mobile and beyond</h2>

        <p><span class="summary">Responsive design is something we integrate into our approach from day one. We firmly believe the web experience will continue along the path of being held on mobile devices.</span> To us, it just makes sense to incorporate future-friendly design such that the capability is there and ready when you are.</p>

        <p>Unlike many similar firms, we perform all design and theming in-house. And unlike many design firms, we do not deliver a fixed number of design concepts or iterations. Instead of this take-it-or-leave-it approach, we earmark a block of time to refine a custom look and feel that creates a positive and intuitive user experience while remaining on-brand and on-message.</p>
