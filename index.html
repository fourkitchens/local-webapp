Four Kitchens' reputation as a leader in the open-source community has earned us invitations to train and speak at numerous conferences around the world.</p>

          <p>Our mission is to change the world by setting knowledge free. We aim to achieve this mission by working with open-source software, engaging free-culture communities, and choosing projects that further the spread of knowledge and ideas.</p>

          <p>The Four Kitchens Web Chefs believe that building a website is like preparing a feast: It requires a team of people with specialized and complementary skills working in parallel to create something that lots of people will enjoy. It's part art, part science, and all about preparation.</p>
